    "#                     one of the key differences is the way the data is modeled in the database. In this section,\n",
    "#                   we'll work through an example of modeling the same data in a relational database and a NoSQL database. Then,\n",

    "#     Features of MongoDB\n",
    "# These are some important features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Support ad hoc queries\n",
    "\n",
    "# In MongoDB, you can search by field, range query and it also supports regular expression searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "# You can index any field in a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Replication\n",
    "\n",
    "# MongoDB supports Master Slave replication.\n",
    "\n",
    "# A master can perform Reads and Writes and a Slave copies data from the master and can only be used for reads or back up (not writes)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Duplication of data\n",
    "\n",
    "# MongoDB can run over multiple servers. The data is duplicated to keep the system up and also keep its running condition in case of hardware failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Load balancing\n",
    "\n",
    "# It has an automatic load balancing configuration because of data placed in shards.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. Supports map reduce and aggregation tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. Uses JavaScript instead of Procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 8. It is a schema-less database written in C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 9. Provides high performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 10. Stores files of any size easily without complicating your stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 11. Easy to administer in the case of failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 12. It also supports:\n",
