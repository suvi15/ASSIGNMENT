    "# Q2. Define the different types of statistics and give an example of when each type might be used.\n",
    "# Ans:- There are two kinds of Statistics, which are descriptive Statistics and inferential Statistics. In descriptive Statistics, \n",
    "#       the Data or Collection Data are described in a summarized way, whereas in inferential Statistics,\n",
    "#        we make use of it in order to explain the descriptive kind. Both of them are used on a large scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Descriptive Statistics:-\n",
    "#    In this type of statistics, the data is summarised through the given observations.\n",
    "#    The summarisation is one from a sample of population using parameters such as the mean or standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Descriptive statistics is a way to organise, represent and describe a collection of data using tables, graphs,\n",
    "#     and summary measures. For example, the collection of people in a city using the internet or using Television.\n",

    "#  It identifies the spread of data. Central tendencies are the mean, median and mode of the data. And the measure of position describes \n",

    "\n",
    "## Inferential Statistics:-\n",
    "# This type of statistics is used to interpret the meaning of Descriptive statistics. That means once the data has been collected,\n",

    "# conclusions from the data that depends on random variations such as observational errors, sampling variation, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Inferential Statistics is a method that allows us to use information collected from a sample to make decisions, predictions or inferences\n",
    "# from a population. It grants us permission to give statements that goes beyond the available data or information.\n",
    "# For example, deriving estimates from hypothetical research.\n",
